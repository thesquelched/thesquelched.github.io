If you're like me and are planning on playing fantasy hockey for the upcoming
2016-17 NHL season, you're probably scrambling to gather data to make
intelligent draft rankings.  I spent the afternoon doing just that, and I've
decided to share the fruits of my labor.  On
[my GitHub page](http://github.com/thesquelchd/fantasyhockey), you'll find:

- [Raw data from Corsica for various game states](https://github.com/thesquelched/fantasyhockey/tree/master/data/corsica)
- [Skater stats from the past three seasons](https://github.com/thesquelched/fantasyhockey/blob/master/data/skater.csv)
- [Basic 4-2-1 weighted projections for skaters](https://github.com/thesquelched/fantasyhockey/blob/master/data/skater_projection.csv)
- And more!

The data include Yahoo draft analysis and include the correct position
eligibility for players in Yahoo leagues.

If you want to contribute, fork the repo and submit a pull request!
